# Stat-Arb-with-Bonds
This program takes in the valuations of two bonds and calculates the yield to maturity (YTM) for each bond. It then calculates the spread between the bond yields and the z-score of the spread. If the z-score of the spread is above a certain threshold, it indicates that there may be an opportunity for statistical arbitrage.
