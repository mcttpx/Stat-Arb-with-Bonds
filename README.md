# Stat-Arb-with-Bonds
This program takes in the valuations of two bonds and calculates the yield to maturity (YTM) for each bond. It then calculates the spread between the bond yields and the z-score of the spread. If the z-score of the spread is above a certain threshold, it indicates that there may be an opportunity for statistical arbitrage.To use this program, you will need to define the Bond class and the ytm() method, which calculates the yield to maturity of a bond. There are various ways to calculate the YTM of a bond, and the specific approach will depend on the details of the bond and the data that is available. This is a simplified form of statistical arbitrage and effective statistical arbitrage requires a more complex and robust program.
